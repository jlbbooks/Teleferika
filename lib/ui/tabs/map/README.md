# Map Components Structure

This directory contains the refactored map components, split from the original large `map_tool_view.dart` file for better maintainability and organization.

## Component Descriptions

### Debug Components (`debug/`)
- **`debug_panel.dart`**: Debug panel widget that displays sensor data, location information, and compass accuracy for development purposes.

### Marker Components (`markers/`)
- **`location_markers.dart`**: Custom location marker with accuracy circle visualization.
- **`map_markers.dart`**: Project point marker generation and styling (moved from root).
- **`moving_marker.dart`**: Moving marker that displays the project azimuth direction as an arrow overlay on the current location.
- **`polyline_arrowhead.dart`**: Animated arrowhead marker that moves along polyline paths.

### Service Components (`services/`)
- **`geometry_service.dart`**: Handles all geometric calculations including bearing calculations, distance measurements, and coordinate transformations.
- **`location_service.dart`**: Manages location and compass data streams, permission handling, and sensor access.
- **`point_service.dart`**: Handles point CRUD operations, database interactions, and point lifecycle management.

### State Management (`state/`)
- **`map_state_manager.dart`**: Centralized state management for all map-related state, including location tracking, compass data, point management, and UI state.

### Widget Components (`widgets/`)
- **`flutter_map_widget.dart`**: Main FlutterMap widget that handles the map rendering, layers, and interactions.
- **`floating_action_buttons.dart`**: Floating action buttons for map controls (extracted from map_controls.dart).
- **`map_loading_widget.dart`**: Loading state widget displayed while map data is being loaded.
- **`map_type_selector.dart`**: Map type selection control (extracted from map_controls.dart).
- **`permission_overlay.dart`**: Permission request overlay (extracted from map_controls.dart).
- **`point_details_panel.dart`**: Panel for displaying and editing point details (moved from root).

### Point Details Components (`widgets/point_details/`)
- **`coordinates_section.dart`**: Editable coordinates component with inline editing capabilities.

### Core Files
- **`map_controller.dart`**: Business logic controller for map operations, calculations, and data management (legacy - being replaced by services).
- **`map_controls.dart`**: Floating action buttons, map type selector, and permission overlays (legacy - being phased out).
- **`map_tool_view.dart`**: Main map view that orchestrates all components and handles user interactions.

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility and is easier to understand and modify.
2. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other parts of the application.
3. **Testability**: Smaller, focused components are easier to unit test.
4. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different components simultaneously.
5. **Performance**: Better separation of concerns can lead to more efficient rebuilds.
6. **Service Layer**: Clear separation between business logic (services) and UI components.
7. **Modularity**: Services can be easily swapped or extended without affecting UI components.

## Architecture

The refactored architecture follows a clean separation of concerns:

- **Services Layer**: Handles business logic, data operations, and external integrations
- **State Management**: Centralizes UI state and coordinates between services and UI
- **Widget Layer**: Pure UI components that receive data and callbacks
- **Main Orchestrator**: `map_tool_view.dart` coordinates all components

## Usage

The main entry point is `map_tool_view.dart`, which imports and uses all the other components. The state management is handled through `MapStateManager`, which coordinates between the UI components and the business logic services.

### Default Map Type Handling

The default map type is no longer hardcoded. Instead, it is dynamically determined as the `singleName` of the first value in the `MapType` enum (using `MapType.values.first.singleName`). This ensures that if the enum order changes or new map types are added, the default will always match the first enum value, making the code more robust and future-proof.

## Migration Status

- ✅ **Completed**: Widget extraction and organization
- ✅ **Completed**: Service layer creation
- ✅ **Completed**: Marker organization
- 🔄 **In Progress**: Legacy file cleanup
- ⏳ **Pending**: Full service layer integration

## State Management

The `MapStateManager` class centralizes all map-related state and provides methods for:
- Location and compass data management
- Point operations (add, move, delete, update)
- Map fitting and navigation
- Permission handling
- Animation control

This separation allows the UI components to focus on rendering while the state manager handles all the complex logic and state transitions.
