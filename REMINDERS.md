# Reminders (open when you start work)

- [ ] **Test BLE data path with physical device** (when you have the RTK/BLE device)  
  → `teleferika.app/lib/ble/ble_service.dart`: `_handleReceivedData` (Uint8List, cached regex, Latin1) was optimized and not yet validated on device. Remove this line after testing.
