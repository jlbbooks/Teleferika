# DartDoc configuration for Teleferika
# 
# This file configures how DartDoc generates API documentation for the Teleferika project.
# DartDoc extracts documentation from code comments and generates HTML documentation
# that can be viewed in a web browser.
#
# For more information about DartDoc options, see:
# https://dart.dev/tools/dartdoc/options

# Output directory for generated documentation
# All HTML files, assets, and documentation will be placed in this directory
output: doc/api

# Whether to include private APIs in the documentation
# Private APIs are those with names starting with underscore (_)
# Set to true to include private APIs, false to exclude them
includePrivate: false

# Whether to include source code in the documentation
# When true, shows the actual Dart source code alongside the documentation
# This helps developers understand the implementation details
includeSource: true

# Whether to use categories to organize the documentation
# Categories group related classes, functions, and libraries together
# This makes the documentation more organized and easier to navigate
useCategories: true

# Files and directories to exclude from documentation generation
# These patterns use glob syntax to match file paths
exclude:
  # Exclude generated files (typically created by build tools)
  - "**/*.g.dart"           # Generated Dart files (e.g., from json_serializable)
  - "**/*.freezed.dart"     # Generated files from freezed package
  - "**/generated/**"       # Any files in generated directories

# External links configuration
# This creates links to external documentation (like Flutter API docs)
linkTo:
  # URL for the Flutter API documentation
  # This allows linking to Flutter classes and methods in our documentation
  url: "https://api.flutter.dev/"
  # Display name for the external documentation
  name: "Flutter API"

# Whether to show library names in the documentation
# When true, library names are displayed prominently in the documentation
# This helps identify which library a class or function belongs to
showLibraryNames: true

# Whether to show package names in the documentation
# When true, package names are displayed in the documentation
# This helps identify which package a library belongs to
showPackageNames: true

# Whether to validate links in the documentation
# When true, DartDoc checks that all links in the documentation are valid
# This helps catch broken links and improves documentation quality
validateLinks: true

# Whether to show verbose warnings during documentation generation
# When true, DartDoc provides more detailed warning messages
# This is useful for debugging documentation issues
verboseWarnings: true

# Whether to suppress non-error output during generation
# When false, DartDoc shows progress information and warnings
# When true, only error messages are displayed
quiet: false
