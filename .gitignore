#pubspec.lock # Some teams commit this, others generate it. Standard practice is to COMMIT it.
             # However, if a team explicitly decides not to, it might be here.
             # FOR MOST FLUTTER PROJECTS, DO NOT ADD pubspec.lock TO .gitignore

# Pub related (global cache is usually outside project, but good to be safe)
# .pub-cache/ # Usually not needed if using global pub cache, but won't hurt.

# FVM (Flutter Version Management) specific
#.fvm/flutter_sdk/ # Exclude the symlinked SDK itself
# Note: You SHOULD commit .fvm/fvm_config.json or .fvm_version (whichever your FVM setup uses)
# So, a more specific rule for FVM might be:
 .fvm/*
 !.fvm/fvm_config.json
# or just ensure you don't commit the flutter_sdk symlink if .fvm/ itself is not ignored.
# Safest is often to ignore the whole .fvm directory and explicitly add the config file if necessary,
# but the standard `.fvm/` entry is common if you manually manage the config file commit.
# A common FVM setup recommends adding `.fvm/flutter_sdk` specifically if you commit the rest of `.fvm`.
# If you ignore the whole `.fvm/` directory, you don't need the specific `flutter_sdk` line.

# Local settings & Environment specific (examples)
*.local
local.properties # Android specific local properties (e.g., SDK path)
